# NewCybAccTeleBot
This is a project that aims to provide a template for scripts that automate the process of creating new trial accounts for websites. 
When a message is sent to the telegram bot it uses selenium to inputs 
a locally created one time email and a randomly generated password and after the sign-up is complete it sends you the credentials as a message on telegram.
